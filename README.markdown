# Detoxify

## The script

**Detoxify** is a command line script written in Ruby for the sole purpose of removing any traces left by version control systems. These traces include hidden files and directories.

In my humble opinion, if you don't intend to use a version control system on a project you just did a checkout, there's no need of keeping those tracking files and directories. If that's the case, Detoxify is suitable for that. Personally, I recommend you to use a version control system and let the tracking structure intact, but there are some moments in which you just want to code alone.
